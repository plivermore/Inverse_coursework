Using the method presented in the lectures, find the best model fit to the given data using nonlinear least squares, assuming that the data are weighted according to their uncertainties: this is the nonlinear analogue of the BLUE.

Confirm that this is so for model parameter A, by plotting the weighted residual sum of the squares against different values of A over a suitable range, assuming that your other parameter values are given by your BLUE.
